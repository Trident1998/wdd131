          For ye shall have great joy and be exceedingly glad, for great shall
          be your reward in heaven; for so persecuted they the prophets who were
          before you.

        <p>
          And now remember, my son, that God has entrusted you with these
          things, which are sacred, which he has kept sacred, and also which he
          will keep and preserve for a wise purpose in him, that he may show
          forth his power unto future generations.
